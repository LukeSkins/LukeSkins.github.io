title: About
---

My name is Luke Skinner, and I'm a high school student at Scripps Ranch High School. I have a knack for web design, graphic design, and anything involving a computer.

I live in sunny San Diego, California, and enjoy my time to explore new skills in the computer design and programming world. I hope to expand my skills, and use them to change the community around me.

Outside of design and development, I enjoy photography, traveling and finding new places for a good cup of coffee.
