This is a portfolio website I am working on to display my basic development skills.

I focus mainly on the design aspect of a web site/app.  Hopefully this site can serve a location to display some of my work, and to provide a hub to contact me through many of my social media accounts.

Please feel free to share it, or contact me regarding anything pertaining to it.
