<div class="six columns">

I'm Luke Skinner, a student living in sunny San Diego, California.  

<br>
<br>

Constantly, I am trying to learn more about people and the way the world works. A surplus of this knowledge is gained through hearing and sharing stories and experiences. The human experience, I believe, is made tolerable through sharing and listening.  

<br>
<br>

I spend my time taking <a href="https://instagram.com/lukeskins">photographs</a>, writing <a href="https://github.com/lukeskins">code</a>, and making coffee. Moreover, I enjoy <a href="/library">reading</a> and <a href="/blog">writing</a> and thinking. Send me a <a href="/contact">message</a> if you ever want to chat.
